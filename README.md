# PJ-Manager
A Launcher/Manager that is used to open multiple programs simultaneously. Handy for people that need to open multiple programs at once to work on a coding project, etc.

# Versions
Currently there are 3 versions of this project, 2 that will be public and a third version i'm working on that rewrites all the code from the ground up.

V1.1 - Released
A Extremly basic version of the program that is hardcoded.

V2.0 - Released But Incomplete
It wasn't finished as some of the changes i wanted to make in future updates would not have been possible without a complete overhaul and hence this version was scrapped.
It does have the following functions the first version didn't have. but it's still hardcoded for the most part, only paths were changable via the config.
 - A Installation/Configuration Menu (Please Note it was extremely early work and might not function as intended.)

V3.0 - Unreleased - Incomplete
This is the version i will be developing and the only one which i will support.
This version is written in python, it will probably be the last version i will create as this version will be the most advanced and most data driven version.
I estimate 80% of the program will be data driven while the other 20% will be hardcoded.
the hardcoded portions will be the About and settings menu's as well as the program setup.
